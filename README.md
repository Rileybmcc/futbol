# Futbol

### Iteration 1, 2, & 3
* Everything should be good to go
* Can be tested through spec/stat_tracker_spec or through the spec harness, both work.
* Subclasses were implemented by Astrid with the thought that they could store frequently accessed pre-chunked bits of data to increase efficiency, but we found other solutions. Including them because they should be useful for further optimization. (Due date p.s.: we actually ended up using them to refactor to break the 5 sec testing barrier. they could be use more elegantly, but this works for now)
* Subclass construction handled by the `TrackerForge` class and based off of the mold of parent class `DataMold`.

### Iteration 4
* The `index.html` page can be generated by running `ruby page_generator.rb` from the top level `futbol` directory.
* It asks for input in the form of a team ID and a season number. These are not validated, please make sure to enter valid values. Possibly something to fix in a future version.
* We didn't know how to test the generator or the `StatTracker#get_binding` method it requires, so we just didn't. Still have a simplecov coverage of >99% though
